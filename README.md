Overview
This project is an independent data analysis exploring factors associated with the success of K-pop groups. Using a provided dataset, the project examines how variables such as company affiliation, debut timing, and other group characteristics relate to measures of success. The goal of this project was to apply data science concepts to a real-world dataset through a self-directed research question.

Research Question
What factors are associated with the success of K-pop groups, and how do company affiliation and debut timing relate to these outcomes?

Data
The dataset contains information on K-pop groups, including debut dates, company affiliation, and other group attributes related to popularity or success. The data was cleaned and prepared prior to analysis.

Methods
The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and comparison of success-related variables across different factors. Visualizations were used to identify patterns and trends. All analysis was completed using Python.

Tools
Python was used for data processing, analysis, and visualization. The project was completed using Jupyter Notebook and common data science libraries.

Results
The results suggest that debut timing and company affiliation are associated with differences in group success. The findings are exploratory and intended to highlight patterns rather than establish causal conclusions.

Notes
This project was fully self-directed, including topic selection, analysis design, and interpretation of results.
